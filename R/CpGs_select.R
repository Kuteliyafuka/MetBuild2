#' extract data from the list of GSE objects
#' @description
#' to extract Î² value matrix and age information from GSE objects.
#' then organize these data, preparing them for downstream analysis
#' the column name of age in pheno_data is not certain, so it is recommended to check the annotation file first.
#' we only consider "age:ch1","age (y):ch1" these two names
#' though dataset_names should be omitted, I do not make it for my laziness :).
